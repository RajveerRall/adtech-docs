With Publishers, you can easily set pricing, configure ad units, and monitor ad performance\u2014all through a single, user-friendly platform.</p> <p>But what exactly is a Supply-Side Platform (SSP)? Essentially, an SSP serves as a technological bridge between publishers and advertisers. It empowers publishers to manage and sell their digital advertising inventory efficiently. Through our platform, you will gain access to a centralized dashboard where they can view ad inventory, fine-tune pricing and targeting parameters, and seamlessly connect with demand-side platforms (DSPs) and ad networks.</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    A[User Visits Page] --&gt; B[Ad Request Generated]\n    B --&gt;|User Data| C[Publisher Collects Data] \n\n    C --&gt; D[Publisher Sends Bid Request]\n    D --&gt;|Targeting Criteria| E[Ad Exchange] \n\n    E --&gt; F[DSPs/Buyer Networks Receive Requests]\n    F --&gt; G[Targeting &amp; Bid Calculation]\n    G --&gt;|Bids| E\n\n    E --&gt; H[\"Ad Verification (Blocks)\"]\n    H --&gt; I[Winning Ad Selection]\n    I --&gt; C[Ad Response to Publisher]\n    C --&gt; B[Ad Displayed to User]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"publisher/publisher/#benefits-of-using-our-platform","title":"Benefits of using our platform:","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Increased revenue: Our platform can help you increase your revenue by providing access to a wider range of demand sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved efficiency: Our platform can help you streamline your ad operations by automating many of the tasks involved in selling and managing digital advertising inventory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Greater control: Our platform gives you more control over your advertising inventory, allowing you to set pricing and targeting parameters and to block or allow specific types of ads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced reporting: Our platform provides you with detailed reporting on your ad performance, which can help you track your progress and make informed decisions about your advertising strategy.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"publisher/publisher/#use-cases-for-publishers","title":"Use cases for publishers","text":"<p>The platform can be used by the following publishers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Website publishers: Our platform can help website publishers monetize their traffic by selling display, video, and native ads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mobile app publishers: Our platform can help mobile app publishers monetize their inventory by selling interstitial, banner, and native ads.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"publisher/publisher/#capabilities-of-publishers-platform","title":"Capabilities of Publishers platform","text":"<p>Our platform offers a variety of features and capabilities to help you manage and sell your digital advertising inventory:</p> <p></p> Dashboard <p>Access a centralized dashboard to view comprehensive analytics, providing insights into ad performance and audience engagement.</p> End Points <p>Easily create end points tailored to the specific types of ads you want to display on your domain or app, ensuring seamless integration with your content.</p> Apps/Domains <p>Whitelist your domain or app end points on ad exchanges, enabling you to receive ads based on your bidding preferences and maximizing your revenue potential.</p> Rules <p>Set customizable rules to block or allow specific types of advertisements on your domain or app, giving you control over the ad content displayed to your audience.</p> Reports <p>Access detailed reports on monetization metrics, including successful bids, failed bids, and invalid bids, allowing you to optimize your ad strategy and maximize revenue.</p> Billings <p>View and track payment invoices along with their status, ensuring transparency and facilitating smooth financial transactions between advertisers and publishers.</p>"},{"location":"publisher/reports/","title":"Reports","text":"<p>Note: This section is under construction.
