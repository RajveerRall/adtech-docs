This feature gives you powerful customization tools to dictate where your ads can and cannot appear based on a variety of criteria. Think of it as setting up traffic lights for where your ads get to travel on the ad placement highway.

* Enhanced Brand Safety: Protect your brand's reputation by proactively blocking ads from appearing on undesirable websites, apps, or next to specific types of content.
* Precise Targeting:  Focus your ad delivery on websites, apps, and audiences that are most likely to be receptive to your messaging, improving campaign efficiency.
* Budget Optimization:  Conserve your budget by preventing ad spending in locations or on content types that are historically low-performing or too expensive.

### Key Parameters Explained 

* Traffic Control: Rules help you control where your ads can or cannot appear.
* Customization: You create the rules â€“ it's about fitting your specific needs.
* Allowing vs. Blocking:
* ALLOW: Only requests matching your rule will get your ads.
* BLOCK: Requests matching your rule won't be able to show your ads.
* Setup Sections
* RULE TYPE: Choose "ALLOW" or "BLOCK."
* APPLY ON:
* END-POINTS: If you want the rule to apply to specific ad types (like video ads for Android).
* CID: Apply the rule to a specific Campaign ID.
* CRID: Apply the rule to a specific Creative ID (an individual ad).
* RULE CATEGORY: What the rule is based on:
* IAB-CAT: Target or block based on website content category (IAB stands for Interactive Advertising Bureau, they have standard categories like Sports, News, etc.)
* COUNTRY/CITY/ZIP/IP/CARRIER: Location-based targeting or blocking.
* BROWSER/IFA/UA: Technical targeting based on the user's device and browsing info.
* DOMAIN: Block or allow ads on specific websites.

## How It Works

* You Create a Rule:  Let's say you want to BLOCK your ads from showing on websites categorized as "gambling" (IAB-CAT).
* DSP Checks In: Every time there's a potential spot for your ad, the DSP will see if it matches any of your rules.
Action:
If your ad matches a BLOCK rule, it won't be shown there.
If your ad matches an ALLOW rule, it's still in the running.

### Example Uses

* Brand Safety: BLOCK ads from appearing on websites with adult content or controversial topics.
* Niche Targeting: ALLOW ads only on websites that cater to a specific hobby or interest that matches your target audience.
* Competitor Avoidance: BLOCK ads from appearing on your competitors' websites or apps.
