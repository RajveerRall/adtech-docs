Advertisers are suggested to add their own as well as other buyers' entries so that publishers can follow and update the same in their domain. This is a transparent way to validate the sellers and buyers in the supply chain.

By adding your ads.txt entries, you publicly declare:
* Who You Are: Your identifier information as an advertiser/buyer.
* Authorized Resellers: DSPs, ad networks, or other intermediaries you allow to resell your ad inventory.

### How It Works

1. You Add Entries
   2. Domain: Your domain name, if you own any websites or apps where you might display ads bought through the DSP.
   3. Your ID: A unique identifier assigned by your DSP or an industry body.
   4. Type: Direct (you're buying inventory directly) or Reseller (you're allowing others to sell on your behalf).
   5. Third-Party ID: The ID of the authorized reseller (if applicable).
6. Publishers Take Note:  Ideally, publishers you want to work with will check your ads.txt file. This helps them confirm that they're dealing with legitimate buyers or resellers when your ad requests come through.
7. Fraud Prevention: This system makes it harder for bad actors to impersonate you and sell ad inventory that they don't control.

### Example Entry

Let's analyze one of the existing entries:
* indexexchange.com, 29648, RESELLER, 50b1c356f2c5c8fc
* Domain: indexexchange.com (an ad exchange)
* ID: 29648 (Unique Index Exchange ID)
* Type: RESELLER (You authorize them to resell your inventory).
* Third-Party ID: 50b1c356f2c5c8fc (Likely their unique ID for you)
