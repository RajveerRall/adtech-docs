This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your advertising performance and earnings. Here's what you'll see:

### Overall Performance
This section gives you a quick summary of how your ads are doing:

* TODAY/YESTERDAY/CURRENT MONTH/PREVIOUS MONTH: These let you compare performance for different time periods.
* REAL TIME: This shows you how many people your ads are reaching (impressions) and how much money you're spending right now.
* Impression/ Spent Graph: This graph visually shows your ad impressions (how many people see your ads) and money spent over a period of time (looks like a day).

### Country Performance 
This shows your ad performance in different countries.

* CON/IMP/FILL%/SPENT $:
* CON: Country (like ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸USA, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³IND, etc.)
* IMP: Impressions (How many times ads were shown)
* FILL%: How often you were able to successfully show your ad on the website or app spaces you wanted.
* SPENT $: How much money you spent on ads in that country.

### Platform Last 7 Days Performance 

This shows the results of your ads over the past seven days:

* DAY: Date

* FREQ: Frequency (how many times an average person sees the ad)
* RES: Response (likely the number of clicks)

### Things To Think About

* Is your performance good? Look for high impression counts and fill rates. You'll need more data to know what's "good" for your industry.
* Where is it working? Focus on countries, platforms, and sites/apps that get the best results.
* What can be improved? If an app or country is expensive with low impressions, consider not advertising there.
