This feature gives you granular control over where your ads can be displayed within your chosen Advertisers network of apps and websites. It's essentially a way to create your own exclusive "approved list" for ad placements.

* Brand Safety: Ensure your ads only appear on websites or within apps that align with your brand values and content standards. Protect against association with objectionable or harmful content.
* Targeting Precision: Directly target your ads to apps/websites where your ideal audience is likely to spend their time, increasing relevance and potentially improving campaign performance.
* Content Suitability: Avoid situations where ads for your family-friendly product end up on an inappropriate or controversial website.

### Use Cases

Reputation Management: A luxury brand might whitelist reputable fashion websites and apps, but exclude gossip sites or apps with unverified user-generated content.
Niche Audiences: A company selling vegan food products could whitelist websites and apps focused on healthy living, vegetarian recipes, or cruelty-free products.
Performance Optimization: If you have historical data indicating particularly strong performance from specific apps or websites, whitelisting them ensures your ads continue to be prioritized on those placements.

### Key parameters explained 

* "Whitelist any app bundle or site domain":  This means you create a list of approved apps (by bundle ID) or websites (by domain name) where you want your ads to show.
* "In case of no white-listed domains or apps...": If you don't create a list, your ads could appear on any app or website the DSP works with.
* "EPID":  Endpoint ID â€“ each type of ad placement (like an Android banner ad) has its own ID number.
* "Want to whitelist? SINGLE / MULTIPLE":
* SINGLE: You want to whitelist only one app or website at a time.
* MULTIPLE: You want to upload a whole list of apps or websites.
* "Whitelist": This section is where you actually list out the apps and websites you want to target:
* Search Bar: Type in names and ID numbers to find the apps and sites you want.
* List Below: Shows you what you've already added to your list.

### Example:

Let's say you're selling kids' clothes.  You could use this feature to:
* Target: Popular kids' game apps and parenting websites.
* Avoid: Apps and websites focused on adult topics.
* Important Note: The note section emphasizes that you need to match domains/bundles to the right end point type. You don't want to put iOS apps on a list meant for Android banners!
