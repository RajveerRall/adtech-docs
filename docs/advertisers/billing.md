This feature allows you to manage the financial side of your ad campaigns on the Advertisers platform.  It operates on a prepaid model, meaning you need to add funds to your account before you can launch campaigns.

* Invoice Generation: You create invoices within the platform itself which detail the amount you're adding, taxes, and will likely provide payment instructions.
* Invoice Tracking: The system helps you monitor the status of your invoices (PENDING or PAID), making it easy to manage your payment history.
* "Add Budget" Section: This is the form where you initiate the process of adding funds to your account.

### "Add Budget" Section

* CURRENCY: Choose the currency you'll be paying in.
* INVOICE DESCRIPTION: A short description to help you identify the invoice later.
* AMOUNT: How much money you intend to add to your account (minimum of USD 100).
* TAX PERCENTAGE: Enter the applicable tax rate for your region.
* Follow Invoice...: This will likely show the generated invoice and provide instructions on how to submit payment. 

### Invoice Tracking Tables
