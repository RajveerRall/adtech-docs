This report is designed to help you identify and analyze ad impressions and clicks that are likely fraudulent, not generated by genuine human users. IVT comes in various forms:

* Bots: Software programs designed to mimic human clicks and browsing behavior.
* Click Farms: Operations where people are paid to generate fake clicks.
* Hidden Ads: Ads that are not visible to actual users (e.g., stacked on top of each other or placed off-screen).
* Accidental Clicks: Clicks that occur unintentionally by users.

### Why IVT Matters
* Wasted Spend: Paying for fake clicks and impressions drains your budget without getting you in front of real potential customers.
* Skewed Performance Data: IVT can make your campaigns look more successful than they truly are, making it difficult to make informed optimizations.
