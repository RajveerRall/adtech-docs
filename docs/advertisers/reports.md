In Monetization reports, you can view exactly how each End Point (ad placement) performs. This fine-grained data helps you optimize individual ad units, compare their revenue, and make informed decisions to maximize earnings from every corner of your SSP.  You can see what's working well and what's not, allowing you to make informed decisions about your ad inventory. Reports also help track trends, measure campaign effectiveness, and ensure transparency with partners.
