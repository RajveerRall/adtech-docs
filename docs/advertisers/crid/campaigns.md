The "Create Campaign" feature is the heart of your DSP (Demand-Side Platform). It's where you set up all the details for a new advertising campaign. Let's break down the different options:

### Key Parameters Explained

* CAMPAIGN TYPE:  This is how you'll pay for your ads:
* CPM: Cost per Mille (thousand impressions) - You pay each time your ad is shown 1000 times.
* CPC: Cost per Click - You pay when someone clicks on your ad.
* CPV: Cost per View - You pay when someone watches a video ad.
* CPL: Cost per Lead - You pay when someone fills out a form (like to sign up for a newsletter).
* CPA: Cost per Acquisition - You pay when someone completes a specific action (like buying a product).
* CPI: Cost per Install - You pay when someone installs your mobile app.
* CAMPAIGN NAME: A  name to identify your campaign, like "Summer Sale Promotion".
* DOMAIN: The website where you want your ads to show up (if you're targeting specific websites).
* PRIMARY / SECONDARY CATEGORY:  These help the DSP understand the content of your ad and match it to the right websites and apps.  For example, if you're advertising headphones, a primary category might be "Technology & Computing" and the secondary category "Style & Fashion".
* TITLE:  The headline of your ad that people will see.
* DESCRIPTION:  A short description about your product or service.

### How It Works
You Fill it Out:  You choose the type of campaign, give it a name, target specific websites (if you want), pick categories, and create your ad's title and description.
DSP Does the Rest: The DSP uses this information to find the best places to show your ad and get you the results you want based on your payment method (clicks, views, etc.).

## Example
Let's say you sell running shoes.  Your campaign setup could look like this:
* Campaign Type: CPC (because you want people to click on your ad and go to your website)
* Campaign Name: Spring Running Sale
* Domain: (leave blank if you're not targeting specific sites)
* Primary Category: Sports
* Secondary Category: Style & Fashion
* Title: Get 20% Off Running Shoes
* Description: Upgrade your run with our latest styles.
With this setup, your ads will target people interested in sports and fashion, enticing them to click and  visit your shoe website!
