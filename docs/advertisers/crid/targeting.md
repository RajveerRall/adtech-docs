This feature gives admins or POCs a high-level view and control over the specific targeting criteria that advertisers have applied to their campaigns or creatives.  Primary uses include:

* Targeting Review & Verification: Ensure that the advertiser's targeting selections are reasonable, align with platform policies, and don't contain errors that could hinder campaign performance.
* Troubleshooting: Assist advertisers in diagnosing issues related to low impressions or unexpected audience delivery if their targeting is overly narrow or incorrect.
* Optimization Suggestions: Based on an understanding of campaign goals and potential audience segments, admins could recommend expanding or refining targeting parameters.
* Platform-Level Targeting: In some cases, admins might have the ability to apply targeting restrictions or safeguards at the platform level that would apply to all advertisers.

### Use Cases

* Preventing Inappropriate Targeting: Block campaigns from targeting audiences in ways that might be discriminatory, harmful, or violate regulations.
* Accuracy Checks: Catch mistakes in location targeting, like incorrect zip codes or mismatched state/city combinations.
* Audience Insights: Help advertisers understand the potential reach of their campaigns based on their targeting choices.
* Competitive Analysis: Potentially identify overlapping targeting between advertisers, aiding in optimization for niche markets.
* Inventory Management: Potentially use the targeting information to manage ad inventory and forecast demand for specific audience segments.
