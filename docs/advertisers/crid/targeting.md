This feature is all about making sure individual ads (called 'creatives') are seen by the absolute best audience for that specific ad.  Think of it as going even more specific than your overall campaign targeting.

### Key Parameters Explained

* DEVICE TYPE: Desktops, smartphones, tablets, even connected TVs (CTV).
* OS: Target users based on their device's operating system (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.).
* CONNECTION TYPE: Zero in on people using WiFi or mobile data.
* COUNTRIES/STATES/CITIES: Go global or get super local!
* ZIP CODE: Target based on zip codes (great for local businesses).
* CARRIER: Target people using specific mobile carriers.

## Example

Let's say you have two running shoe ads:

- **Ad 2 Targeting:**
Location: Broader geographic range.
