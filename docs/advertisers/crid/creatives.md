The "Creative" feature is to upload the actual advertisements people will see. Let's break down the key parts:

#### Before You Start
The Billing Section: The note at the top reminds you that you must have funds added to your account before creating ads, as you'll need to set a budget.

### Key Parameters Explained

* SELECT CID (Campaign ID): This is where you choose which campaign your new ad will be a part of. Each campaign has its own unique ID number.
* AD FORMAT: The type of ad you want to create:
* BANNER: A static image ad.
* VIDEO: A video ad.
* NATIVE: An ad designed to blend in with the content of the website or app.
* AUDIO: A sound-based ad.
* PUSH: A pop-up notification ad.
* POP: An ad that takes over the entire screen.
* SIZE:  The dimensions of your ad (this is especially important for banner ads).
* CONTENT TYPE  How you will create your ad:
* IMAGE UPLOAD: Uploading a pre-made image file.
* HTML: Writing your ad creative in HTML code.
* JS: Using JavaScript code to create more interactive ads.
* LANDING PAGE:  The website address where people will go if they click on your ad.
* SELECT DATE:  When you want your ad to start running.
* USER FCAP / IP FCAP:  Ways to control how often a single person sees your ad.
* BUDGET: How much money you're willing to spend on showing this specific ad.
* PRICE:  The cost per impression, click, or action (depending on your campaign type).

### How it Works

* You Design: You choose the ad type, size, and create the ad itself either by uploading an image or using code.
* Upload & Connect: You upload the ad to the DSP and connect it to the right campaign.
* DSP Takes over: The DSP tries to get that ad placed in the apps and websites you targeted!

## Example

Let's say you're still running your running shoe campaign. You could create a:
* Banner ad showcasing a new shoe model
* Size: 300x250 (a common size)
* Image upload: Use a cool photo of someone running in your shoes
* Landing page: The product page for that specific shoe on your website.
