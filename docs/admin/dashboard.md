The primary function of the Admin Panel dashboard is to provide a real-time, consolidated overview of key performance metrics and trends across both your SSP and DSP platforms. This centralized view empowers you to:

- **Monitor Platform Health**: Quickly assess the overall status of your ad tech ecosystem.
- **Identify Trends**: Spot patterns in user activity, campaign performance, and revenue over time.
- **Track Potential Issues**: Proactively identify areas that might require attention, such as low fill rates or high IVT (Invalid Traffic).
