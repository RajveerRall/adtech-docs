This feature gives admins or POCs direct control over the specific websites and apps (domains) where an advertiser's ads are allowed to be displayed.  Its primary goals are:

Brand Safety: Ensuring ads are placed on content that aligns with the advertiser's values and brand image.
Targeting Precision: Allowing advertisers to specifically choose websites or apps that resonate with their target audience.
Campaign Optimization: Improving performance by refining ad placement and avoiding websites or apps that historically have not led to conversions for the advertiser.

### Use Cases

* Content Suitability: Prevent ads from a family-friendly advertiser ending up on websites with objectionable content.
* Niche Targeting: Ensure ads for a specific product (ex: luxury watches) appear on relevant websites and apps catering to a high-income demographic.
* Performance-based Refinement: Block domains where an advertiser's ads consistently have low click-through-rates or don't generate conversions.
* Competitor Avoidance: An advertiser might block the domains of their direct competitors to prevent their ads from being displayed side-by-side.

### Key Parameters Explained

* ADV ID / ADV EPID: Identifiers associating the whitelisted app/domain with a specific advertiser and their endpoint.
* WL ID: Unique identifier for each whitelisting entry.
* DOMAIN / APP BUNDLE ID: Either the website URL or the app's unique identifier.
* URL / STORE URL: The full website address or the app's page on an app store.
* APP/SITE NAME: Descriptive name for easy identification.
* PRIMARY / SECONDARY CATEGORY: Detailed content classification based on the IAB framework for accurate targeting and content safety.
* STATUS: Controls whether the whitelisted app/domain is ACTIVE, PENDING for review, or BLOCKED.
* ACTION: Additional control, allowing admins to temporarily 'stop' ads from appearing on the whitelisted entity (while maintaining the whitelist approval).
