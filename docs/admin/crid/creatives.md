This feature provides admins or POCs with a centralized view and granular control over the individual ad creatives (banners, videos, etc.) that advertisers have submitted for use in their campaigns. Its primary functions include:

* Creative Review & Approval: Meticulously examine each creative to ensure they adhere to your platform's technical specifications, quality standards, and content guidelines.
* Compliance: Protect your platform's reputation by blocking creatives that are misleading, offensive, or violate industry regulations.
* Troubleshooting: Help advertisers resolve creative-related issues that might prevent ads from being displayed properly or optimally.

### Use Cases

* Brand Safety: Prevent ads with inappropriate imagery or messages from appearing on your network.
* Technical Checks: Ensure correct file formats, sizes, and that creatives function as intended across different devices and browsers.
* A/B Testing Facilitation: Assist advertisers in testing multiple creative variations by easily approving and rotating different versions.
* Creative Quality: Reject poor quality, blurry, or low-resolution creatives that could negatively impact user experience.
* Regulatory Adherence: Enforce rules specific to regulated industries (e.g., disclaimers, age restrictions).

### Key Parameters Explained

* ADV ID / CID / CRID: Identifiers associating the creative with a specific advertiser, campaign, and a unique creative ID.
* AD FORMAT: The type of creative (banner, video, native, audio, etc.).
* SIZE: Dimensions of the creative (particularly important for banner ads).
* CONTENT TYPE: Specifies whether the creative is an image file, HTML code, or a JavaScript snippet.

* LANDING PAGE: The URL a user is directed to upon clicking the ad.
* START / END TIME: Allows for time-based scheduling of creatives.
* IP / USER FCAP: Frequency capping settings to limit how many times the creative is shown to an individual user or from a single IP address.
* BUDGET: If your platform supports creative-level budgeting, this would control the spend for the specific creative.
* PRICE: Likely refers to a bidding parameter if your DSP uses creative-level bidding.
* STATUS: Controls whether the creative is PENDING for review, ACTIVE, or BLOCKED.
* ACTION: Additional control, likely to 'stop' a creative from being served, but retain it on the platform for future use.

### Admin Panel Workflow

* Creative Submission: Advertisers upload or create creatives within their account.
* Admin Verification: Admins carefully examine each creative, evaluating content, technical aspects, and adherence to policies.
