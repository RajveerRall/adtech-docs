Endpoint reports provide a detailed view of the performance and activity associated with specific endpoints on your Publishers and DSP platforms. Endpoints are the technical connection points used by publishers to display ads (Publishers endpoints) and by advertisers to bid on ad placements (DSP endpoints).

### Use Cases

- **Troubleshooting**:  Investigate issues related to low fill rates, discrepancies in impressions or revenue, and other technical problems. Endpoint reports let you pinpoint if a problem is isolated to a particular publisher or advertiser endpoint.
- **Optimization**: Analyze performance metrics for each endpoint to identify high-performing publishers or advertisers. Conversely, you can spot underperforming endpoints that might require configuration adjustments.
- **Fraud Detection**: Monitor endpoint activity for suspicious patterns or unusually high traffic volumes that might suggest invalid traffic or fraudulent activity.

## Key Parameters Explained

- **PUB ID / ADV ID**: Unique identifiers for publishers (SSP side) and advertisers (DSP side).
- **PUB EPID/ ADV EPID**: Unique identifiers for the specific endpoints associated with a publisher or advertiser.
- **GROUP BY**: Allows you to organize the report data by various criteria (date, endpoint, domain, etc.), making it easier to spot patterns.
- **DATA**: Standard performance metrics similar to your dashboard: Requests, Responses, Wins, Impressions, Clicks, Revenue, Cost, Profit.
