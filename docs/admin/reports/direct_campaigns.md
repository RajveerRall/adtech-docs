Direct Campaigns Reports focus on campaigns where advertisers have made direct deals with specific publishers within your platforms (as opposed to bidding on ad placements in real-time auctions). These reports provide granular data on campaign performance and targeting.

### Use Cases

- **Tracking & Monitoring**:  Get a detailed breakdown of campaign metrics (impressions, clicks, revenue, etc.) to ensure campaigns are delivering as expected.
- **Troubleshooting**:  Identify any issues with underperforming campaigns, such as low impressions or conversions. The granular targeting data lets you pinpoint if the problem lies with specific segments of the audience.
- **Optimization**: Analyze performance across different targeting parameters (e.g., country, device, ad format).  This helps advertisers refine future campaigns and improve results.
- **Fraud Detection**: Monitor for discrepancies or unusual patterns suggesting potential fraudulent activity within specific campaigns.
