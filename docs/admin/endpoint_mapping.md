This feature allows admins or POCs to establish direct connections between specific publisher endpoints (SSP side) and advertiser endpoints (DSP side).  By creating these mappings, you can customize how ad requests are handled and potentially facilitate more streamlined bidding and ad delivery.

### Use Cases

* Private Marketplace (PMP) Configuration: Endpoint mapping is essential for setting up PMP deals where a publisher offers specific ad inventory to a specific advertiser, often at negotiated prices.
* Preferred Partnerships: Create direct mappings to foster relationships between high-quality publishers and advertisers even outside of PMP deals, potentially improving fill rates and performance.
* Targeted Ad Delivery: Establish mappings based on geographic targeting to ensure ads from a certain advertiser are prioritized for inventory in the preferred locations.
* Optimization: Analyze mapping data to identify well-performing pairings and make adjustments for better campaign outcomes.

### Key Parameters Explained

* MAPPING ID: A unique identifier for each mapping you create.
* PUB ID / PUB EPID: Identifiers for the specific publisher and endpoint.
* ADV ID / ADV EPID: Identifiers for the specific advertiser and endpoint.
* COUNTRY: Allows for targeting specific countries or regions with the mapping.
* FLOOR MARGIN: Potentially allows setting a price floor for this specific mapping, overriding default settings.
* PUB SHARE: Might refer to revenue share between the publisher and the platform for ads served through this mapping.
* ACTION (Stopped/Running): Controls whether the mapping is active and ads are being served through it.

### Using the Endpoint Mapping Feature

* PMP Setup: Create mappings with the relevant publisher, advertiser, deal ID, pricing, and targeting parameters to facilitate a PMP.
* Strategic Connections: Establish mappings to encourage ad delivery between compatible publisher/advertiser pairs based on your knowledge of your ecosystem.
* Fine-Tuning: Start or stop mappings to test performance and refine targeting over time.
