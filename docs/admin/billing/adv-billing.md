This feature provides admins or POCs with tools to manage financial transactions and billing for the advertisers on your platform. It has three primary functions:

* Billing Status Overview:  Gives a clear view of each advertiser's invoice history, including invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and payment status (paid or pending).
* Budget Management:  Allows admins to directly add funds to an advertiser's account, increasing their available budget for running campaigns.
* Invoice Generation & Editing: Empowers admins to create new invoices for advertisers based on campaign performance, apply taxes, and optionally edit existing invoices.

### Use Cases

* Streamlining Billing Processes: Centralizes invoice management and potentially automates parts of the billing cycle for your platform.
* Financial Oversight: Allows admins to track outstanding payments and identify any potential billing discrepancies.
* Flexible Budgeting: Gives admins the ability to help advertisers quickly increase their campaign spend in response to opportunities or positive performance.
* Custom Invoicing: Useful for scenarios where advertisers require specific invoicing formats, line-item details, or billing outside of standard automated campaigns.
* Billing Corrections: Admins have the power to modify invoices if there were errors in calculations or changes in campaign scope are needed.
