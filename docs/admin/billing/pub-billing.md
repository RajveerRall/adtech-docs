The billing feature in an admin panel provides Admins/POCs with a centralized view and management of view invoices, publishers earnings from advertising campaigns. It allows to track key billing metrics, including:

* Total earnings
* Paid and pending amounts
* Earnings by month
* Individual invoice details

### Use Cases
Publishers can use the billing feature to:

* Reconcile their earnings with advertising campaign data.
* Monitor payment schedules and identify any discrepancies.
* Download invoices for accounting purposes.
* Analyze trends in earnings over time to understand campaign performance and identify optimization opportunities.

The billing feature is typically used in conjunction with other reporting features in the admin panel to provide publishers with a comprehensive understanding of their ad campaign performance and financial standing. For example, a publisher might use the billing feature to see how much revenue a particular campaign generated, and then compare that data to the campaign's click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate in the reporting section. This would allow the publisher to assess the effectiveness of the campaign and make adjustments as needed.
