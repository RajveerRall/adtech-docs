Similar to the publisher profile, this section provides admins or POCs a centralized view of advertiser information.  The main focus is on managing contact details, controlling billing updates, and establishing revenue share terms (though revenue share is less common for DSP relationships).

### Use Cases

* Account Management: Update advertiser company names, contact information, website domains, and geographic locations.
* Billing Lock: Prevent advertisers from frequently changing their billing information to maintain consistent and accurate invoicing.
* Payment Terms: Define payment cycles for advertisers if they are pre-paying for ad spend (e.g., monthly deposits) and manage related settings.
* Profile Controls: Temporarily lock advertiser profiles as needed during troubleshooting, billing disputes, or potential fraud investigations.
* Audit & Compliance: Maintain a history of profile and billing changes for auditing purposes, tracking who made updates and when.

### Key Parameters Explained

* ADV ID: Unique identifier for the advertiser account.
* ADV NAME: Name of the advertiser or their company.
* ADV DOMAIN: The advertiser's website or a relevant campaign landing page.
* COUNTRY: The geographic location of the advertiser.
* REVENUE SHARE %: Not typically applicable to the DSP side, but possibly included if your platform has revenue-sharing components with advertisers.
* PAY TERMS: If applicable, establish agreed-upon payment cycles for pre-paid advertising budgets.
* PROFILE STATUS: Control whether advertiser profile information can be edited freely or is locked.
* BILLING STATUS: Specifically allows locking or unlocking of billing detail updates.

### Using the Advertiser Profile Feature

* Onboarding: Accurately collect advertiser information and set any necessary billing parameters during initial account setup.
* Billing Integrity: Use the "lock" function for large advertisers or when ensuring billing accuracy is critical.
* Verification Checks: Potentially lock the profile temporarily while investigating discrepancies, suspicious changes, or for further verification of an advertiser's legitimacy.
* Auditing: Review the change history on profiles to maintain a transparent audit trail of modifications.
