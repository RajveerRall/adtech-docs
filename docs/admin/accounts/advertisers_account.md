This section of your admin panel gives admins or POCs direct control over creating and managing advertiser accounts on your DSP. Advertisers are the ones seeking to purchase ad inventory for their campaigns. Strong advertiser relationships and account management are essential for the success of your ad tech platform.

### Use Cases

* Account Management: Edit advertiser information, update campaign settings, troubleshoot issues, or change account status (active/blocked).
* Billing and Financial Management: Potentially integrate with billing systems to track advertiser spending and manage payment processes.
* Security & Verification: Implement advertiser verification processes and monitor account activity through IP tracking and API key control.

### Key Features Explained

* EMAIL: Primary contact email for the advertiser.
* PASSWORD: Securely hashed/encrypted password for the advertiser's account login.
* CREATED ON: The date the advertiser account was created.
